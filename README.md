## Intro

A single page app featuring a map of a neighborhood. With features including featured locations, third-party data about those locations (Foursquare API), and various ways to navigate through the content.

In this project I learn how to make AJAX calls to API's ([Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com)) and how to manipulate the responses to create content in a Website.

The app shows some hotspots in Florian√≥polis downtown, places that I like to go to celebrate and hangout with friends.



## Instructions

Just open the index.html in a modern browser
